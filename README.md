# Store


This is a Java program that simulates an online store with notebooks and smartphones.



The program creates instances of several classes such as Brand, Notebook, and Phone and stores them in lists.
It then displays the list of notebooks and smartphones in the store as well as a list of brands.


The program then prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 3 to select an operation to perform.
Entering 1 will display a sorted list of notebooks, 2 will display a sorted list of smartphones, 3 will display a list of brands, and 0 will exit the program.
After the user enters a valid input, the program displays the corresponding list.



The program uses Scanner to take user input and Collections.sort() to sort the lists. 
It also implements the Comparable interface in the Notebook and Phone classes to define a natural order for the objects. 
The program also uses ArrayList to store the lists of objects.
